						<span id="first-letter">S</span>rinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician born in present
						day Tamil Nadu. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made
						extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and
						continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation;
						it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became obvious and known to
						the wider mathematical community, centered in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership
						with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The Cambridge professor realized that Ramanujan had
						rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new ones.
					</p>
					<p class="passage">
						Srinivasa Ramanujan's academic journey was fraught with challenges and setbacks. Despite his profound mathematical talents, he faced repeated failures in formal education until he arrived at Cambridge University. It was there, in 1916, that he finally achieved a significant milestone by obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Science (B.Sc). This accomplishment marked a pivotal moment in Ramanujan's life, as it validated his extraordinary mathematical abilities and opened doors to further opportunities for him to contribute to the field of mathematics on a global scale.					</p>

					<p class="passage">
						Srinivasa Ramanujan's life was marked by a constant struggle with health issues, 
						a battle that intensified during his time in England. Despite his extraordinary 
						mathematical talents, his physical well-being was fragile. His health deteriorated significantly
						, and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, a disease that ravaged his body, coupled with a severe vitamin deficiency. This grave diagnosis forced him into confinement within a sanatorium, where he fought against his ailments with determination.

						In 1919, recognizing the severity of his condition and perhaps longing for the familiarity of his homeland,
						 Ramanujan made the difficult decision to return to Kumbakonam in the Madras Presidency, India. However, 
						 the move did little to alleviate his suffering, and tragically, he passed away at the tragically young age
						  of 32 in 1920, leaving behind an immense legacy in the world of mathematics.
						
						Following Ramanujan's untimely death, his widow, S. Janaki Ammal, faced the daunting task of carrying on without 
						him. She eventually relocated to Bombay, where she sought to rebuild her life. However, the memory of Ramanujan's 
						brilliance and the enduring impact of his work remained ever-present. Despite the passage of time, Janaki Ammal's bond
						 with her late husband endured, and in 1950, she returned to Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the city where their
						  journey together had begun. There, she lived out the remainder of her days, surrounded by memories of her beloved husband, until she passed away at the remarkable age of 95 in 1994.					</p>
